a) The purpose of this program is to utilize for loops, and also figuring out certain shapes to input integers into(such as Pascal's triangle). 
b) For Q1, the input includes the integer given. For Q2, the input is the number of rows. 
c) For Q1, the ouput is all of the integers from 2 to 100 that are prime numbers. For Q2, the ouput is Pascal's triangle with the correct number of rows and correct integers. 
d) The execution included are for loops and if statements in the termimal. 
e) My program could be improved with efficiency. I feel like the way that I inputted everything could have been done in a more organized manner.
